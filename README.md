## Attention
The current KL divergence term for the VAE for dependent data is faulty and needs a fix before this model can be properly used

## Sources
- The implementations of the VAE and training framework follow this repository: https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE
- The utility functions for generating data and visualizing results were taken from this paper & the accompanying code: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14933.pdf
